Python Snippets
===============

I felt in love with Python 3 years ago when working on a project at my previous company, Cazoodle.
Since then, I often use Python to solve a wide range of problems, from text processing to heavily computation.
This repository will include useful Python snippets written by me or found on Internet.
Hopefully you will find something useful here.
